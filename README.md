Video Tracking algorithm using Mean Shift

Steps for execution - 

1. Select the desired Region of Interest to be tracked throughout the video sequence.
2. Use the mouse cursor to draw a bounding box around the object. This code assumes that the bouding box has been drawn by chosing the upper left corner pixel first and then lower right corner. 
3. Chose the desired kernel properties for density estimation.
4. The algorithm will track the selected feature over the frames and sequence them back into a video file.
